I am a master's student at the [Graduate School of Data Science (GSDS)](https://gsds.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University. My advisor is Professor [Sanghack Lee](https://www.sanghacklee.me/), who is leading the Causality Lab. Before joining the Causality Lab, I majored in Economics at Seoul National University. My interests span multiple areas, including causal inference, machine learning, economics, philosophy, and so on. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary approaches that bridge ideas across fields to drive progress in academia, industry, and society. I welcome conversations with people from diverse backgrounds—please feel free to reach out.
